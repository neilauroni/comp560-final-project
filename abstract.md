# Project Abstract

The project will focus on developing a song discovery system that leverages song embeddings and natural language processing. The goal is to extend my existing work in song embeddings to build an LLM-based interface, enabling users to input natural text and receive tailored song recommendations.

The system will use a large language model with song embedding techniques to capture the semantic characteristics of music and its contextual associations. By processing user-provided text, the LLM will extract themes, sentiments, and key descriptors that define the user's mood and preferences. These insights will be matched against a database of song embeddings to generate personalized recommendations that align with the user's expressed tastes.

Key objectives include:
- **Enhancing Song Embeddings:** Refining embeddings to better encapsulate musical elements and context.
- **LLM Integration:** Developing and fine-tuning a language model to interpret and transform natural language into actionable music discovery insights.
- **Effective Matching:** Designing a recommendation engine that accurately maps text-derived insights to relevant songs.

The expected outcome is a system that eases the music discovery process by enabling natural, conversational interactions. This project aims to show the intersection of NLP and music recommendation technologies, potentially setting the stage for more engaging user experiences in digital music platforms.
